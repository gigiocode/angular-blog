    "title":"LIQUID BEAT THE GAIMING GLADIATORS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME",
    "description":"Liquid defeated the Gaimin Gladiators in the first division of the DPC Western Europe. This is the first loss of the season for durachyo and his team. On the first map of the confrontation, Gaimin Gladiators picked Windranger for durachyo, and Liquid picked up Monkey King for Micke. The beginning of the meeting went on without an advantage for one of the teams. Only 27 minutes into the match, there was a fight over Roshan, from which the Gladiators emerged victorious. After taking the Aegis, the Gladiators led by nearly 10,000 gold, but even that didn't work out. The Liquid was able to successfully take a dash for a dash-2 tower on the middle line and kill their opponent even with the Aegis. The Gaimin Gladiators game fell apart. The next key fight was on the top line, where durachyo died right after the buyback and Liquid deservedly won on the first map.",

    "description":"Both teams approached the series not in the best shape having two losses in the two played matches of the current DCP round. And while Secret in their last game managed to put up a fight against the Gladiators, losing 1-2, the OG quite unexpectedly lost to Quest Esports. On the first card OG decided to surprise Yuragi with a Magnus for 23 picks. And the hero performed well at the laning stage, he was the only one of his team who was able to stay on top of the networth. However, the other two lines were cleanly lost, which resulted in a 2-14 lead in scoring and 5,000 in gold by the 20th minute for OG. Further midline brawling gave them a little hope when Team Secret decided to respond to the deaths of their two supporters without the Tidehunter Ultimates, which resulted in a full-fledged teammate. But the next 10 minutes already put everything in its place, Team Secret began to gain their advantage again as if nothing had happened, winning fight after fight. This went on until the 50th minute, when the Puppey team, who was in no hurry, carried out another series of kills, including the kerry team OG Yuragi, who had no buyback and forced the latter to write the cherished two letters. As for the results of the first card, we should mention the excellent play of Crystallis on Monkey King, who skillfully avoided Doom Ultimates and finished the game with 15/1/7 stats, and Armel on Windranger from the middle line - 12/3/12",

    "description":"Invictus Gaming beat Piggy Killer. And Team Aster destroyed Team Bright. Both meetings ended with a score of 2-0. The first map of the match went on for a long time without any clear advantage. On the 25th minute IG managed to get Roshan and started gaining the advantage right away. Piggy Killer tried to turn the game around, but it didn't work. A lost fight for a tier-2 tower on the top line cost them the game. Emo did great on Windranger and finished with a 14/1/11 stat. On the second map, Piggy Killer had no answer. All lines for them were lost, and the gold advantage was already 8,000 towards IG by the 14th minute. It became difficult to play and Piggy Killer couldn't get back into the game.",

    "description":"VIRTUS.PRO 2-1 HYDRA. Virtus.Pro barely missed out on the Berlin Major last season; this season was time to bounce back. After losing to BetBoom a few days ago, their next opponent is Hydra, who are currently sitting at a 1-2 record. On Game 3 VP had a better draft for farming out the map, allowing them to build up a 19,000 gold lead at 35 minutes despite not getting many kills. Kiritych on his Luna had a net worth of 26,000 and walked up to Hydra's high ground to end the game with no issues.",
